                    Simon, a paradox: a man feared in the criminal underworld yet controlled by discipline and drill.<br><br>
                    A powerful yet shadow like figure in the European underworld, Simon Richter is both a brutal strategist and a scarred individual.<br>
                    Born into hardship, forged in war and destroyed by betrayal, he has become what his callsign always alluded to: a shadow.<br>
                    His empire, built on blood, power and his endless desire for dominance now stretching across Europe and beyond its borders, running behind the facade of legitimacy his companies grant.<br><br>
                    Yet beneath the surface, ghosts of his past continue to haunt him: reminders of what he has lost and maybe, what he still has left to lose.

                        <p>
                            Born in Munich, growing up in one of the citys rougher districts. He is the youngest of three children. His older brother was lost to crime early, leaving only his sister Leonie to look after him. <br><br>
                            His parents were strict, rough and unforgiving, putting all three of them through rigorous drill without much to look up to or hope for. Simon knew early on that he had to take matters into his own hands to safe himself from the fate his brother chose... <br>
                            which worked in the beginning, but ended up failing after his time in the military

                        <p>
                            Simon joined the Bundeswehr (German Army) at 17, excelling in combat tactics and leadership early on, showing remains of his rough childhood and aspects of life he learned on the streets as a kid. <br><br>
                            Due to his skills he was selected for KSK (Kommando Spezialkräfte), the elite unit of the Bundeswehr, being one of the youngest members to ever make the cut. <br>
                            During his time in the military, he operated across conflict zones, taking part in numerous classified missions that shaped his now ruthless and dark mindset <br><br>
                            His capture and torture during a mission, the betrayal by his own government that followed, lead to a shift in his worldview, forcing him into the life he always despised and had sworn to destroy.

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>
                            Combining the skills and discipline he learned in the military with strategic thinking and knowledge of the streets, Simon took control of a major cartel, overthrowing the previous ruler in a brutal fight for power, only coming out on top due to his old unit joining him in the fight.<br><br>
                            The later established Richter Holdings Group, a multi layered empire blending his legitimate businesses with the criminal aspects, now forms his power. <br><br>
                            He controls major industries through front companies while expanding cartel operations across Europe and other continents. While his companies act in the light, he prefers remaining in the shadows, never revealing too much about himself to ensure his state of fear, respect and strategy to stay in power.

                            Simon is deeply attentive to his partner’s pleasure. Although he naturally assumes a dominant role, he is adaptable and prioritizes consent and clear communication before revealing his more personal kinks.

                            Simon rejects any non consensual acts, extreme public displays of intimacy, inclusion of third parties, and dangerous elements (such as knife/gun play or excessive pain) that might trigger past traumas.

                            Despite his steely exterior, Simon values deep emotional connection after intimacy—whether through cuddling, affirmations, or shared baths—to help ground him and reinforce mutual trust.
